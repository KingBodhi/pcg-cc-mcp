## 1. Flowfield Atlas
Treat the project as a flowfield: boards become orbitals, pods and assets flow as currents whose thickness shows workload recency.
```
        Pods      Assets
          \        /
           \      /
    [Pod]~~>➤➤➤[Executive Board]➤➤➤~~[Task]
                ↗        ↘
        [Brand Board]    [Dev Board]
                 ↘        ↗
                [Social Board]
                     ↓
                  [Project]
```

## 2. Multiverse Timelines
Parallel timelines for the four boards; wormholes connect related work across lanes.
```
Time ➜  |——— Exec ——●————●————●————|
         \        ↘        ↗
          |——— Brand ———●———●———●—|

            ↘        ↗
          |—— Social ——●———●———●—|
Nodes = tasks/assets •  Wormholes = ↗↘ cross-board links
```
